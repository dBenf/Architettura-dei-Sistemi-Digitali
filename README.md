# Architettura-dei-Sistemi-Digitali
This repository contains the exam projects of the **Architetture dei Sistemi Digitali** course (AY 20/21) at the *University of Naples Federico II*.

## Exercises
The repository contains all the exercises developed in VHDL using **Vivado 2022.1**, which are described in the pdf [documentation](/documentation.pdf) file. The examination projects are:
- [Exercise1](/Exercise_1) : design, implementation and simulation of a 4:1 decoder, in structural and behavioural mode;
- [Exercise2](/Exercise_2) : design, implementation and simulation of two sequence recognisers in different implementation modes;
- [Exercise3](/Exercise_3) : design, implementation, simulation and synthesis on FPGA of a watch-chronometer;
- [Exercise4](/Exercise_4) : design, implementation and simulation of a shift register with 4 operating modes;
- [Exercise5](/Exercise_5) : design, implementation and simulation of a machine for calculating the modulus between two numbers;
- [Exercise6](/Exercise_6) : design, implementation and simulation of a buffering comunication between two systems;
- [Exercise7](/Exercise_7) : design, implementation and simulation of a component to calculate the scalar product between vectors;
- [Exercise8](/Exercise_8) : study of MIC-1 processor operations and modification of an instruction;
- [Exercise9](/Exercise_9) : design, implementation, simulation and synthesis on FPGA of two different modes of operation of the UART component;
- [Exercise10](/Exercise_10) : design, implementation and simulation of a multi-stage switch using the omega-network model;
- [Exercise11](/Exercise_11) : design, implementation, simulation and synthesis on FPGA of a Booth multiplier and a non-restoring divisor.
